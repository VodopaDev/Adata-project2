Cleaning:

* Remove useless columns that are empty (Community Areas, Zip codes, Historical Wards) or redundant (ie State and City columns only contains IL and CHICAGO respectively).
* Clean shop names to group for easier grouping.

Ideas:

* Investigate what are the most common reasons to fail an inspection and the weight of them in the verdict.
* Are violations related to location (ie touristic vs residentential, old vs new district, rich vs poor)? This can be visualized with a (pretty) map thanks to the latitude/longitude.
* Compare how franchises (Subway, Macdo, ...) differ from "normal restaurant"
