# alien's guide to chicago restaurants - safety first

You are a starving alien who is travelling through the universe. You had an accident with your spacecraft so you made an emergency landing somewhere on the Earth. You discovers the fifty-star-spangled flags and three-star-spangled flags on street. Being an alien who has some knowledge in different countries and flags on the Earth, you correctly guesses that you are somewhere in Chicago, U.S. "What a relief", you say to yourself, "at least I can read English!"
Suddenly, you feel starvation. You need to find something to eat, somewhere that sells food. Fortunately, you can see a lot of facilities that seems to serve food. But you have no idea which place is safe to go. Bewildered, you ask Adata2 team for help.
"I am starving. Can you tell me which restaurant to visit? All I know is that I am somewhere in Chicago. I don't really care how the food tastes, but I do care for safety."

## introduction of Chicago food inspection
To get the ideas of safe restaurants in Chicago, we first need to see how Chicago food inspection works for restaurants in general. How often are restaurants inspected conducted and how many of them pass? What are the main causes of failure? Are there other sociological or geological features that are correlated with certain tendancies?

## Franchises vs individual Restaurants

Roughly, there are two ways of choosing a place to eat. One is eating at a franchise restaurant that is already familiar to you, the other is challenging a restaurant you have never seen before. Which will be a safer action? 

### Bird's eye view: Is franchise restaurant safer than individual restaurants?

Here is quick look at the average number of inspections and inspection pass rate between non-franchises (less than 5 restaurants have the identical name) and franchises. Both verage inspections and pass rate are higher in franchise restaurants, by ???????????????10%. More inspected and passed, we can say that the franchise restaurants are slightly safer the the other.

### Which restaurants are more independent of socioeconomical factors? 
We now live in world where ecomonic conditions influence almost every sector of society, and restaurantation and neighbor environment are some examples. 

The inspection pass rate for non-franchise restaurants reflects the socioeconomical factor more strongly. We can see a meaningful correlation between the median household income and inspection pass rate within a same neighborhood. 


#### To summarize, franchise restaurants in Chicago not only had themselves inspected more often than non-franchise counterparts, but also passed inspection better. Moreover, their inspection pass rate was less affected by the economical status(?) of their community, whereas the non-franchises reflected the power of having wealthy neighbor.
